# Memory Game

This is a simple Memory Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game involves matching pairs of cards with the same value. The goal is to find all pairs in the shortest time possible.

## Description

The Memory Game is a browser-based game that challenges the playerâ€™s memory. The game consists of cards, each with a letter on one side. The cards are shuffled and placed face down. The player flips two cards at a time, trying to find matching pairs. If the cards match, they remain face up; if not, they are flipped back face down.

The game includes:
- A 4x4 grid of cards.
- A timer and score can be added for future enhancements.
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop devices.
